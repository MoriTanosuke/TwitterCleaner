What is this?
=============

This is the application TwitterCleaner. I've been building it to test the Google AppEngine
and have a useful application that I'll use myself. And one usecase is still unsolved:

    How can I delete all my tweets from Twitter?

Every now and then I stumble upon this question. Mainly when I'm unsure if I should open 
my twitter account for the public, or keep it private.

This application is running at

in a more or less functional version. Give it a try if you want to bulk delete your tweets.

Continuous Integration

I'm setting up a continuous integration server at
